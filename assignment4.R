# 1. A factory claims that the average lifetime of its LED bulbs is 2,000 hours. A random sample of 120 bulbs shows a mean lifetime of 1,950 hours with a standard deviation of 150 hours. At the 1% level of significance, test whether the companyâ€™s claim is valid.

# 2. A random sample of 400 students in college A has a mean score of 55 in an aptitude test with a standard deviation of 10. Another independent sample of 500 students in college B has a mean score of 57 with a standard deviation of 12. Can we conclude at the 5% significance level that students of college B perform better than those of college A?

# 3. A manufacturer claims that 95% of the items produced are defect-free. Out of 600 items chosen at random, 570 items are found to be defect-free. Test at the 5% level of significance whether the claim is true.

# 4. A survey of 1,000 families in rural areas showed that 400 families own a television. A similar survey of 1,200 families in urban areas showed that 700 families own a television. Test whether there is a significant difference between the proportions of families owning a TV in rural and urban areas at the 1% level of significance.
