# normal distribution - continuous random variable
# pdf of mean m and sd sigma is given by:
# f(x) = 1/(sigma x root(2 pi)) x e^(x - mu/2 sigma)^2, x and u b/w - infinity and infinity
# standard curve - bell

# standard normal distribution
# mean is 0, sd is 1
# mgf = e^(ut + t^2 sigma^2/2)

# Q.1 A normal distribution has my 20 and sd is sigma. The normal variate z = (x - mu)/sigma. P(15 <= x <= 40) = ?
# when x = 15, z = -0.5
# when x = 40, z = 2

# to find area under the given curve (bell)
